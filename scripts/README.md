### Prerequisites for Azure:
1. **Install Azure CLI**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install azure-cli
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Setup**:
   ```bash
   az login
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   az extension add --name containerapp
   az extension add --name acr
   ```

## üîß Common Workflows

### Complete AWS Deployment:
```bash
# 1. Package and publish
./scripts/package-and-publish.sh v1.0.0

# 2. Deploy to AWS
./scripts/deploy-aws-version.sh develop v1.0.0

# 3. Cleanup when done
./scripts/cleanup-aws.sh develop
```

### Complete Azure Deployment:
```bash
# 1. Package and publish to Azure
CLOUD_PROVIDER=azure ./scripts/package-and-publish.sh v1.0.0

# 2. Deploy to Azure
./scripts/deploy-azure-version.sh develop v1.0.0

# 3. Cleanup when done
./scripts/cleanup-azure.sh develop
```

### Multi-Cloud Deployment:
```bash
# Deploy to both clouds
./scripts/package-and-publish.sh v1.0.0
CLOUD_PROVIDER=azure ./scripts/package-and-publish.sh v1.0.0

./scripts/deploy-aws-version.sh prod v1.0.0
./scripts/deploy-azure-version.sh prod v1.0.0

# Cleanup both clouds
./scripts/cleanup-aws.sh all
./scripts/cleanup-azure.sh all
```

## üìã Prerequisites

### For AWS:
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Appropriate IAM permissions
- Docker installed

### For Azure:
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated
- Container Apps and ACR extensions
- Docker installed
- Contributor or Owner role on subscription/resource group

## üîê Security Notes

- Both scripts create necessary security resources (IAM roles, managed identities)
- Secrets are stored securely (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Network access is properly configured
- Health checks ensure application availability
- Cleanup scripts handle dependencies correctly

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Authentication**: Ensure proper cloud provider authentication
2. **Permissions**: Check role assignments and permissions
3. **Resources**: Verify required resources exist (registries, vaults)
4. **Extensions**: Install required Azure CLI extensions
5. **Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are configured

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# AWS
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws ecr describe-repositories
aws apprunner list-services

# Azure
az account show
az containerapp list --resource-group histowalk-rg
az keyvault list --resource-group histowalk-rg
```

### Cleanup Safety Features:
- **Confirmation prompts** for all destructive operations
- **Double confirmation** for production environments
- **Force flag** for automated scripts (use with caution)
- **Dependency checking** to prevent errors
- **Resource existence validation** before deletion
- **Graceful error handling** for missing resources

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cleanup Warnings

### Important Safety Notes:
- **Permanent deletion**: All cleanup operations are irreversible
- **Production environments**: Require double confirmation
- **Shared resources**: ECR/ACR deletion affects all environments
- **Data loss**: All application data will be permanently deleted
- **Cost implications**: Deleting resources stops billing immediately

### Best Practices:
1. **Test cleanup** on development environments first
2. **Backup important data** before cleanup
3. **Verify resources** in cloud console after cleanup
4. **Check billing** to ensure resources are deleted
5. **Document customizations** that might not be recreated
